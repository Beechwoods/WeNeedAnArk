				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>On 1 Peter 5:7 After a question asked of @CSLCHSnMore</p>\n<p>The New International Version (NIV) translates 1 Peter 5:7 as 'Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you'.</p>\n<p>J.B Philips' New Testament paraphrase rather beautifully expresses it like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, humble yourselves under God’s strong hand, and in his own good time he will lift you up. You can throw the whole weight of your anxieties upon him, for you are his personal concern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But what does this mean practically?</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"1 Peter 5_7.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/77539/2023/1-peter-5-7.jpg\" alt=\"1 Peter 5 7\" width=\"1996\" height=\"1622\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I came to Christ in my late forties having spent a lifetime looking for meaning everywhere but in God. Initially my interest in the Bible was one of intellectual curiosity. But as I read that started to change, to a point where things flipped from curiosity to conviction and unequivocal faith.</p>\n<p>It took a while for me to let down my defences and pray properly. But when I did it really felt like throwing myself at Christ’s feet and saying ‘here I am; I believe; you are real and I know you are there for me’.</p>\n<p>To the question asked: when I share my burdens in prayer, or even just get on my knees, address God and mumble jumbled thoughts in my head (which happens when it’s all too much or I’m too tired to think straight) I feel lighter afterwards. Physiologically less stressed. Years ago I was once prescribed diazepam for anxiety and the result is the same (though without the disinhibition associated with medication). When I think about the effect that prayer has on my stress response, given how foreign the concept of prayer was and my initial skepticism about it's power, I still find it remarkable.</p>\n<p>There is a reason why people over the centuries have got on their knees to pray, head bowed, hands clasped. It is a posture of submission. In some respects a posture of defeat; an acknowledgement that my works have failed; that I give myself to you, God. That you have authority and control over me and my circumstances and this world.</p>\n<p>Prayer can be a balm, a salve.</p>\n<p>Throwing your anxieties on God is something very real when you have true belief that He is listening and that in Him you will not be tested beyond your limit. We believers must remember that we have the Holy Spirit within us who strengthens us beyond anything we could have imagined before we were first saved.</p>\n<p>But that is something for another day. You will know it when you see it.</p>\n",

Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.’</p>\n<p>There was purpose and intent to the timing of God’s unveiling for me. Perhaps part of that purpose was that I would write these thoughts down and that they might touch someone. I know that the sadness I have about my lost years pales into nothing compared with the pain Job and Hosea endured in God’s plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Joel 2:25</strong> tells us that God will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you.</p>\n<p>There is life after death. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; all things are become new. <strong>2 Corinthians 5:17</strong>.</p>\n<p>But still, as a husband and a father, there are things that cannot be changed, the consequence of decisions made by a version of me that was impetuous, immature and thought he had it all figured out.</p>\n<p>When I was a child I remember being taught at school the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard (<strong>Matthew 20</strong>). The underlying message that God's grace is not earnt but is a gift was not the one I recall being highlighted at the time. It always confused me. Looking back though, there's another element relevant to those of us called Christ late in the day. That we are as valuable to The Lord as those called early.</p>\n<p>If I could go back and do things differently I would. So many things would be easier now if I had realised where the truth lay twenty or thirty years ago. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. But would I have the character I have now, if it weren't for the journey I've been on? When it comes down to it my life is not my own. Christ and the Holy Spirit chose when to bring me to Him. There must have been a reason for that, after all Matthew 7:14 tells us that the gate is narrow <em>and the way is hard</em> that leads to life (<strong>Matthew 7:14</strong>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lord, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered how fleeting my life is. You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. My entire lifetime is just a moment to you; at best, each of us is but a breath.</p>\n<p><strong>Psalm 39:4-5</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our life in this world is but a breath. Our inheritance is eternal, pure and undefiled.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is by his great mercy that we have been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead.</p>\n<p>Now we live with great expectation, and we have a priceless inheritance - an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Peter 1:3-4</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>I came to Christ in my late 40's, just over two years ago.</p>\n<p>My salvation and my yearning for Christ is not shared by my wife.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if this is a rare scenario or just one that people in my position are ashamed to speak about, but it is one of the hardest things to handle when you are committed to your spouse and understand how your marriage must model Christ's love for and commitment to the Church.</p>\n<p>The article below is the first I've come across which seems to understand this situation, even at all biblically. I mean I wish it was just that my wife just didn't take my faith seriously, but the truth is that it is a massive bone of contention; something where we are diametrically opposed.</p>\n<p>But Almighty God did not give up on Israel despite it's hardness of heart. Christ gave himself whilst we were still sinners. Ephesians 5 doesn't come with caveats: <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her</span>, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.</em></p>\n<p>I am convinced that God placed me in this situation for a reason. If it were His will He would bring my wife to Him. I have tried. And there is time. Just because my prayers are not being answered now does not mean they will not be answered. And I know that we are going through other trials which are not lending themselves to the opening of her heart to the Holy Spirit, right now.</p>\n<p>But can you imagine having to make a choice between going to Church and honouring your commitment as a husband? Or baptism and your marriage? It is that fundamental. I want to give myself to the Kingdom. But in a word, it ain't that simple.</p>\n<p>You may be asking why I don't just put my foot down. I'd ask what kind of marriage would that be.</p>\n<p>Yahweh had 400 years to bring Israel round; I don't have that long. There is also childhood trauma and hurt playing into her anger at God. Perhaps I was placed here, now, knowing that it would take time.</p>\n<p>When Peter wrote his first letter and addressed wives in the early Church (1 Peter 3:1-2), I believe he was considering the situation where wives were coming to Christ first. He didn't tell them to get indignant, he told them to win their husbands by their behaviour, 'without words'.</p>\n<p>And he ended with a note to <em>Husbands, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">in the same way</span> be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing will hinder your prayers.</em> (1 Peter 3:7)</p>\n<p>As I finish writing, I'd appreciate your prayers. It is my fervent wish that God works a wonder in our lives and brings my wife to Him. In His time is fine, but it would be nice if it were sooner rather than later 🙂</p>\n<p>In Jesus' name.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>[www.americasfamilycoaches.com/blog/2020...](https://www.americasfamilycoaches.com/blog/2020/3/27/ani0idyaa68uoajwev4hqjyp4fm3sn)</p>\n",

I identified tribally with the bands and groups I listened to. I dressed in ways that were influenced by the bands I liked and I prided myself in the eclecticism of my taste, and the depth of my collection. When I wasn't listening to music, I was obsessively focused upon amassing the gear to play it. I had a reputation in certain collecting communities for my work archiving old recordings. But in my heart I knew that I was finding my meaning in all the wrong places, and that my hobby was an idol.</p>\n<p>I want to write this down because it might resonate with others out there. The intention of this is not to get legalistic. You listen to what you like. Do not feel that you must listen to worship music only to be a 'good Christian'. Do not be embarrassed about the fact that you enjoy secular music. Do use discernment though, and ensure you don't make others stumble, if they have more concerns than you. Much modern music and modern culture hates God, either through it's obsession with hedonism and sexual themes, or through the antics of stars themselves and the culture that raises them up. There is much to be discerning about.</p>\n<p>For me, I want to focus on some specific areas where I have been convicted. These come from the heart of real music obsessive, not a casual fan or young person with posters on their wall. That was me when I was 15. Thirty five years later, I believe that there are a number of different dimensions where a new Christian may feel conviction: Identity, Collecting, Focus and Distraction, Content, and Motivation.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I will cover all of these areas as we work through this topic together. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Identity</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.</p>\n<p>1 John 3:1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Christians by definition should find their identity in Christ.</p>\n<p>When I was 15 I thought of myself as an 'Indie Kid'. I grew up in the 80's and was lucky enough to live through the golden age of post-punk independent music: Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr, Pussy Galore, Godflesh, Loop, Prong, Carcass, Bolt Thrower. My Bloody Valentine, Pale Saints, House of Love, Fields of the Nephilim. The Sugarcubes, Pop Will Eat Itself, The Darling Buds, The Shamen.</p>\n<p>For a long long time, since I first heard Dark Side of The Moon as a five year old, I was into seventies Progressive rock.I collected Pink Floyd obsessively, trading live tapes with people around the world before easily sharing music on the internet was a thing. </p>\n<p>Bands like Consolidated were a gateway to anti-establishment politics, to the point that I went on to study politics at university, becoming very active in left-wing politics and protest. That had been another major identity for me, surrounded by like minded friends affirming the truth of our outlook, against the rest of the world. And dreadlocks.</p>\n<p>As time went on and I settled, got a job, and had children going to Festivals would allow me to live out the fantasy of being a new age hippy, with beat-up camper van and military surplus boots.  I loved 'festival scene' bands like Radical Dance Faction and Ozric Tentacles. I got into IDM, electronic dance music, bands like Boards of Canada, Aphex Twin and Eat Static.</p>\n<p>My identity was always through the music. As time went on I found new music but never left the old, resulting in a tendency to kaleidoscope between different genre based identities depending upon what I was listening to or who I was with. </p>\n<p>There was pride in being the biggest fan with the most interesting stuff. Which brings me onto...</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Collecting</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God’s love for them.</p>\n<p>Jonah 2:8</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Collecting by its nature elevates objects to something more. Idols. This distinction can be discerned by how you would feel if you lost that item, or if it were damaged. How would you feel. Does your collection own you, or do you own your collection. </p>\n<p>For me I had a passion for two things. Old reel to reel tapes, and old live recordings. Both were scarce. The former expensive, the latter just difficult to find. Both rewarded patience and work to track down and obtain them. This work, and the fixation on finding them resulted in an emotional investment which is difficult to break from. </p>\n<p>Over time there is a tendency for any effort to collect to become like train-spotting. A tick-box exercise in filling the gaps. When collecting music this is an easy trap. There are amazing online databases that tell you exactly what there is to find. Both official and unofficial. And with such things as live recordings, there is the pursuit of 'quality'. Of getting a copy closer and closer to the original recording. And once the original recording is tracked down, getting a careful copy on the best equipment is the ultimate objective. In this pursuit I may have collected 20 or more copies of the same show, all in the pursuit of the 'best copy'.</p>\n<p>The snare of the collector is not confined to music of course, nor secular music, but the collector mindset is one that Christians should be aware of. We should be able to walk away from our collections without feeling like we are losing a piece of ourselves.</p>\n<p>I had a friend once, many years ago, who was born again and gave away their collection. A seriously good collection of live recordings that they had invested much time in, and which they were well recognised for. I respect that. If the loss of your collection would break your heart, then your heart is not for Jesus. You need to be able to walk away.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Focus and Distraction</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What else does this craving, and this helplessness, proclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness, of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him, seeking in things that are not there the help he cannot find in those that are, though none can help, since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object; in other words by God himself.\"</p>\n<p>Blaise Pascal, Pensées</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I was younger I would spend hours, weeks, months, listening to music, reading about the bands and the scenes, chasing leads on recordings or releases. In my teens, in the days before the internet I would trade tapes with contacts around the world, copying cassettes in real-time. I had 500 Pink Floyd live tapes alone, by the time I went digital. I would listen to albums obsessively, reading the sleeve notes and transcribing lyrics. Writing to fan clubs. There were admittedly worse things I could have been doing with my time, but looking back, and now, it was wasted time and focus. It was time spent looking in the wrong place for peace and meaning.</p>\n<p>It is very easy to get fixated on a new target, a new band or acquisition and it's easy to find that this has pushed everything else out of mind. And when, finally, you find what you were looking for, the satisfaction almost immediately pales. And a new target takes its place. It is an ultimately empty pursuit. It is empty because in the end, these things will never satisfy. The hole we are trying to fill is God-shaped, to paraphrase Pascal.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Content</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</p>\n<p>John 15:19</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the thing that most Christians seem to focus on when considering the threat from secular music, modern secular music. When I was 16 I met my father's brother for the first time. My uncle was Plymouth Brethren. I was wearing a Joy Division t-shirt and he warned me earnestly that rock music was demonic. That struck me as very weird at the time. Very little of the music I listened to was overtly anti-Christian. Joy Division had no demonic agenda. Thinking back, my t-shirt had 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' on it. I can see how antithetical that notion is to a Christian worldview. And it's that borderline that I currently find troubling.</p>\n<p>There is an awful lot of overtly un-Christian secular music, mostly hedonistic, self-centred, hyper-sexual, or provocative in terms of symbolism, imagery or lyrics. That stuff is obvious. Christ sought out sinners but not to affirm them. We are called to be in the world, but not of the world.</p>\n<p>One of my favourite albums was <a href=\"https://bocpages.org/wiki/Geogaddi#Themes\">Geogaddi</a> by a duo called Boards of Canada. They do quite chilled-out electronic music that evokes childhood and the countryside. They sample seagulls and campfires. But they also flirt with themes like numerology, and The Branch Davidians. These themes are very cleverly interwoven, knowingly clever, I think they want people to find the clues. They have a track called The Devil Is In The Details, where according to one fan-wiki \"The bassline and melody of The Devil Is In The Details are an octave and a major sixth apart. The bassline/melody repeats the first note three times, yielding three consecutive \"sixths\" in a row, i.e. 6-6-6.\". The album is 66 minutes, 6 seconds long. This has come to make me feel deeply uncomfortable. Knowing jokes or not, the devil is insidious.</p>\n<p>Pink Floyd interpolated a <a href=\"https://alliesbibleblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/05/allusion-3-pink-floyds-sheep/\">rewriting of Psalm 23</a> into 'Sheep' on their 1977 album Animals. I understand the point they were trying to make with that song, but again, it has made one of my favourite songs by them very difficult to listen to. Their intention with that song doesn't just target establishment religion and it's place within societies control structures, it targets me and God's word.</p>\n<p>Another of my favourite albums was Arif Mardin's musical interpretation of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcRuolPSta4\">The Prophet</a> by Kahil Gibran, with Robert Harris reading the text. Harris' voice is sublime and Arif Mardin was a master arranger, who assembled a stellar cast of 70's jazz musicians for the project, but I find the concept troubling now, as if in defiance of Biblical truth. Mystical works such as Gibran's risk replacing God's truth. I find that difficult.</p>\n<p>A lot of the music I now listen to is instrumental. I love jazz. Music is a gift of God. It is a universal language and can speak directly to our emotions in a very profound way. This is not an accident. Just as God made beauty in the rules of mathematics, he made beauty in music. The first for the head, the second for the heart. </p>\n<p>It is interesting how some of the most beautiful music is created by some of the most troubled, and flawed individuals. Conduct for me becomes a problem when it is held up as an example to follow. We all have aspects of ourselves that we would prefer others did not know about, and the lifestyle of the musician puts them in temptations way more than many occupations. One of my favourite musicians is the jazz pianist Bill Evans. Bill died tragically at the age of 51 after what one friend called 'the longest suicide in history'. He first used heroin in the late 50's, and this, plus cocaine addiction was the blight his life until the end. But he never glamourised it. Few outside his circle knew about it and he remained prolific, performing has last show 5 days before his death. It is a dreadful shame that he didn't live into old age, particularly as the shows of his final year are amongst the best of his career.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Motivation</strong></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</p>\n<p>Colossians 3:17</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just as we give glory to God through how we do, not what we do - as a cobbler gives glory in the quality of his stitching not simply by putting a cross on each shoe - we can use our love of music, whether secular or not, to reach others. We do not do this by assimilating to the world, excusing the excesses of modern culture, and holding on to our passions like wooden gods, but by being a light to the world, an example to others. Pointing to the cross.</p>\n<p>My experience since accepting Christ is that I no longer yearn for the sanctuary I found in music, collection and tribalism, like I did. It just stopped being that all-consuming passion that it once was. My heart turned to Christ, to understanding God's word and how it applied to my life. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new</p>\n<p>2 Corinthians 5:17 </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________________________</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">That 'infinite abyss' that Pascal wrote of no longer demands it be filled with the work of human hands.<br /><br />As with all things of this world, we must use discernment to ensure we keep our eyes focused on what is right, and what is good. We cannot hold on to the old idols. But there is glory in all of God's creation, whether nature, or music, both secular and non. It is possible to give Him that glory without removing ourselves completely from the world He has created. We must ensure though that our hearts are pointed towards the right place.</span></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Then Jesus said to His disciples, 'If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.  For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.'</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Matthew 16:24-25</span></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"MIller and Soden Book Cover.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/77539/2024/c3fad40c64.jpg\" alt=\"Miller and Soden Book Cover\" width=\"600\" height=\"927\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>I've just finished reading Miller &amp; Soden's 'In The Beginning ... We Misunderstood', which promised much but ultimately left me stronger in my view of a young earth, literal six day creation.</p>\n<p>The book states that it seeks to interpret Genesis 1 as the ancient near-easterners did, the Exodus era Hebrews to whom Moses first presented Genesis.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell it says that Genesis 1 is figurative, and that it 'recasts' Egyptian and Mesopotamian creation stories to show that Yahweh is the one true creation God.</p>\n<p>The bottom line though is that this rips both the divinely inspired nature of Genesis, and the fundamental truth of Genesis from the foundation and heart of scripture. </p>\n<p>While the authors claim that theirs is not an attempt to rewrite Genesis in light of modern scientific understanding, that science is not fixed, and that to force scripture to align with science is a fools errand, their flimsy theological arguments and assertions do suggest that their master is science and the theology is being made to fit. The same points are made repeatedly and are less argued than just stated.</p>\n<p>I'm just a regular guy, but I feel strongly that regular people have just as much right to an opinion as 'educated theologians'. I do feel that I am in good company though. Soden and Miller say nothing about what the early Church fathers might have thought, and repeatedly imply that young earth creationism is more of a modern concept, popularised by the book The Genesis Flood by Henry Morris and John Whitcomb published in 1961.</p>\n<p>This is a serious omission, but I can see why they chose not to, as the young earth, literal six day view of creation was the consensus view within the Church all the way through until and even well after The Enlightenment. Serious challenge to the literal reading of Genesis 1 is a very modern phenomena.</p>\n<p>Miller and Soden make some interesting points about the numbering of the creation days - the first being 'one day' rather than 'first day'  and the importance of the sixth day, as determined by it being 'the' sixth day. But these are minor points.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally I think the reviewer on '<a href=\"https://thinkingtobelieve.com/2013/05/28/what-ive-been-reading-in-the-beginning-we-misunderstood/\">Thinking to Believe</a>' has it right when he notes in passing that 'If Genesis 1 is a recasting of the Egyptian creation account, then no revelation would be required for Moses to write what he wrote. If God was inspiring the book, we would expect for God to make a theological point using actual history, not fabricated myths.'</p>\n<p>And this gets to the heart of the matter. </p>\n<p>Genesis is not just another creation story. It is THE creation story. Jesus believed it to be literally true, quoting Genesis 1:27, Genesis 2:24, and Genesis 5:2 in Matthew 19. Why would the early Hebrews believe Moses 'recasting' of the old stories? Jesus certainly wasn't scared of confronting pre-existing cultural norms, why would Moses, when under direct inspiration and regarding the then most important story ever to be told?</p>\n<p>It does not surprise me that there are parallels between ancient creation stories and Genesis. Flood narratives abound because The Flood actually happened and that experience is seared into the memories of many ancient cultures, who preserved it in their own oral traditions and historic narratives. Likewise stories of the Creation.</p>\n<p>Creation happened. Humanity's collective consciousness about the event will have carried it's shadow down the generations from Adam and Eve into the four corners of the Earth over the 2,500 years or more until Moses committed the truth of the event as God chose to share it - around the time of the Exodus. </p>\n<p>No man witnessed creation, and The Bible does not say whether Adam and Eve were told about the events prior to <em>their</em> creation, but the stories of the pre-man world predated the revelation of Genesis, and this common consciousness will have informed many creation narratives.</p>\n<p>Almost at the end of the book there is a quote from a friend of Johnny Miller's, a 'top-notch geneticist who retired from Cornell University. He had been an atheist most of his life, and said that even after becoming a Christian, for a long time he remained a “compromised” Christian and a theistic evolutionist. He wrote:</p>\n<p>I am now a creationist. I am getting stronger and stronger scientific reasons to defend my position, but these are not the real basis of my faith. As I have studied Scripture I have seen that believing God is “counted as righteousness,” and that unbelief really is sin. Salvation comes from surrendering: 1) our will, 2) our heart, and 3) our mind to the Lord. Have you done step 3? Would you be willing to be a fool for Christ?'</p>\n<p>And that sums up how I feel. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Useful resources:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Read the book on Scribd: <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/book/323339414\">https://www.scribd.com/book/323339414</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://answersingenesis.org/church/the-early-church-on-creation/\">Answers in Genesis article</a> on the Early Church Fathers view on  Creation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://creation.com/in-the-beginning-they-misunderstood\">Creation Ministries International rebuttal</a> of Miller and Soden.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://thinkingtobelieve.com/2013/05/28/what-ive-been-reading-in-the-beginning-we-misunderstood/\">A review of the book on the Thinking to Believe blog</a> which makes some interesting points, but who's view ultimately I disagree with. </p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Here is the only way to real peace.</p>\n<p>One of the greatest tragedies in the life of the Church today is the way in which so many are content with these vague, general, useless statements about war and peace instead of preaching the gospel in all it's simplicity and purity.</p>\n<p>'Blessed Are They Which Do Hunger And Thirst After Righteousness'. If this verse is to you one of the most blessed statement of the whole of Scripture you can be certain you are a Christian. If it is not, then you had better examine the foundations again.</p>\n<p>We have been told that we must be poor in spirit, that we must mourn, that we must be meek. <br /><br />Here we begin to look for a solution. For the deliverance from self for which which we long.<br /><br />It is the great charter for every seeking soul.</p>\n<p>It is doctrinal. It emphasises one of the most fundamental doctrines of the gospel, namely, that our salvation is entirely of grace, or by grace. That it is entirely the gift of God.</p>\n<p>Remember 'blessed' means happy. The whole world is seeking happiness, but it is the great tragedy of the world that it never seems to be able to find it.<br /><br />According to the Scriptures, happiness is never something that should be sought directly.</p>\n<p>It is always something that results from seeking something else.<br /><br />Whenever you put happiness before righteousness you will be doomed to misery. Put happiness in the place of righteousness and you will never get it.</p>\n<p>Think of a man who is suffering from some painful disease. If the doctor only treats the pain, and does not discover the cause of the pain, and treat that, he is a very bad doctor. He is doing something that is extremely dangerous to the life of the patient.</p>\n<p>We are not meant to hunger and thirst after experiences. We are not meant to hunger and thirst after blessedness. If we wabtr to be truly happy and blessed, we must hunger and thirst after righteousness.<br /><br />Experiences are a gift from God, but we must covet and seek righteousness.</p>\n<p>What is this righteousness then? It is not a sort of general righteousness or morality between nations.<br /><br />Men wax eloquent about how countries threaten the peace of the world, break their contracts, yetr are disloyal to their wives and disloyal to their own marriage contracts.</p>\n<p>There are those who say that righteousness means justification. It does.<br /><br />But it also means santification. <br /><br />It means ultimately the desire to be free from sin in all it's forms and in it's every manifestation. A desire to be free from sin because sin separates us from God.</p>\n<p>Our first parents were made righteous in the presence of God. They dwelt and walked with Him. That is the relationship a righteous man desires. <br /><br />And it means the desire to be free from the power of sin. To get away from the power that drags him down in spite of himself.</p>\n<p>It means a desire to be free from the very desire for sin. We find that the man who turly examines himself in the lift of the Scriptures is not only in the bondage of sin, more horrible yet is he LIKES IT, he WANTS IT! Even after he has seen it is wrong he still wants it.</p>\n<p>To put it positively, to hunger and thirst after righteousness is nothing but the longing to be positively holy. He who does, is a man who wants to show the fruit of the Spirit in every action and in the whole of his life and activity.</p>\n<p>But what does it mean to 'hunger and thirst'. It does not mean that we can attain this righteousness by our own efforts. That is the worldy view of righteousness which focusses on man and leads to the individual pride of the Pharisee.</p>\n<p>It leads to those things that the apostle Paul describes in Philippians 3 as 'dung'. The first Beatitude tells us that we must be 'poor in spirit' so it cannot be that worldly view of righteousness.<br /><br />It is a consciousness of our deparate need.</p>\n<p>It is something that keeps on until it is satisfied. It is not just a passing feeling, a passing desire. It hurts, it is painful, it is like actual, physical hunger and thirst.<br /><br />It is like a longing for a person. There is always a great hunger and thirst in love.</p>\n<p>The Psalmist has summed it up perfectly in a classical phrase: 'As the hart panteth afcter the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God, My soul thirsteth of God, for the living God.</p>\n<p>As J. N. Darby said, 'when the prodigal son was hungry he went to feed upon husks, but when he was starving, he turned to his father.'<br /><br />Finally, let's look at what is promised to the people who are hungry and thirsting for righteousness. <br /><br />'They shall be filled'.</p>\n<p>The whole Gospel is there. That is where the gospel of grace comes in. It is entirely the gift of God. You will never fill yourself with righteousness, you will never find blessedness apart from Him.</p>\n<p>When you and I know our need, this hunger and starvation, this death that is within us, then God will fill us. This is an absolute promise. If you are really hungering and thirsting after righteousness you will be filled.<br /><br />How does it happen?</p>\n<p>It happens - and this is the glory of the gospel - it happens immediately, thank God. We are justified by Christ and His righteousness and the barrier of sin and guilt between us and God is removed.<br /><br />You are no longer under the law, you are under grace.</p>\n<p>God looks at you in the righteousness of Christ and He no longer sees the sin.<br /><br />The Christian therefore should always be a man who knows that his sins are forgiven.<br /><br />He should not be seeking it. He should know he has it. That he is justified in Christ freely by the grace of God.</p>\n<p>Thank God it happens immediately.<br /><br />But it is also a continuing process. The Holy Spirit, begins within us His great work of delivering us from the power of sin and from the pollution of sin. Christ will come into you.</p>\n<p>And as He lives in you you will be delivered increasingly from the power of sin and from its pollution. You will be enabled to resist Satan, he will flee from you. You will be able to stand against him and his fiery darts.</p>\n<p>Finally, this promise is fulfilled perfectly and absolutely in eternity. There is a day coming when all who are in Christ and belong to Him shall stand in the presence of God, faultless, blameless, without spot and without wrinkle. A new and perfect man in a perfect body.</p>\n<p>But there is a paradox. At this moment I am perfect in Christ, and yet I am being made perfect.<br /><br />The Christian is one who both hungers and thirsts AND IS AT THE SAME TIME filled! You reach a certain stage in sanctification but you do not rest on it. You go on changing!</p>\n<p>From glory to glory to glory 'till in heaven we take our place'. Perfect yet not perfect. Hungering, thirsting, yet filled and satisfied, but longing for more, never having enough because it is so glorious and wondrous.<br /><br />Fully satisfied by Him yet a supreme desire to know Him.</p>\n</div>\n",

Yet again, we are reminded that the Christian is altogether different from the world.</p>\n<p>He is a new man, a new creation. He belongs to an entirely different kingdom. And if we are obviously different from the non-Christians around us, this tells us a great deal about of profession of the Christian faith.</p>\n<p>The Jews that Christ was speaking to expected a materialistic and military kingdom, with Him on the throne. They were not expecting a kingdom of the meek. It was important to confront that.</p>\n<p>The meek are NOT THOSE who trust to their own organising, their own powers and abilities, their own institutions, they are the reverse of that.</p>\n<p>'Blessed Are The Meek'. These Beatitudes get increasingly difficult. It demands that we allow others to say critical things to us. We are happy to say we are a wretched sinner, but how do we feel when someone else tells us the same thing!</p>\n<p>The Lord Jesus exemplifies meekness in the face of his enemies, and in his submission to His Father. He says that 'the father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works'.<br /><br />This meekness is not a natural quality. Every Christian is meant to be like this.</p>\n<p>It is something that is produced by the Spirit of God. <br /><br />It is compatible with great strength, authority and power. The martyrs were meek but never *weak*. God forbid that we should confuse this noble quality with something merely animal or physical or natural.</p>\n<p>Meekness is a true view of oneself, expressed through attitude and conduct with respect to others.<br /><br />You see how inevitably it follows being 'poor in spirit' and 'mourning'. The meek man is not proud of himself. He does not want to be. He is ashamed of it.</p>\n<p>The meek man - for blessed are the meek - does not make demands for his position, his privileges, his possessions, his status in life. Christ did asset that right to equality with God. He deliberately did not. And that is the point to which you and I need to come.</p>\n<p>The man who is truly meek is the one who is amazed that God and man can think of him as well as they do and treat him as well as they do.</p>\n<p>It also means that we are ready to listen and learn - that we have such a poor idea of ourselves, our capabilities that we are ready to listen to others.<br /><br />We learn to accept that 'vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord'. He will repay. We have nothing to do</p>\n<p>We who are meek have already inherited the earth. As Paul said 'having nothing, and yet possessing all things'. <br /><br />But in the future kingdom 'do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?'. We will judge the world. We will judge angels!</p>\n<p>Nothing but the Holy Spirit can humble us. Nothing but the Holy Spirit can make us poor in spirit and make us mourn because of our sinfulness and produce in us this true, right view of self and give us this very mind of Christ Himself. -- Dr M. Lloyd-Jones</p>\n</div>\n",

But the meaning is entirely spiritual. He is happy who mourns in spirit.</p>\n<p>Absence of this in the Church is one reason why it is failing to evangelize. As Christians more closely approximate the Beatitudes, they are more sucesful in drawing others in. But not false piety. To be religious is not to be miserable!</p>\n<p>But we will not attract other to the faith through forced brightness and joviality. We fail to see the true depth of sin AND fail to understand true Christian joy. A double failure!<br /><br />That results in a superficial kind of person and a very inadequate Christian life.</p>\n<p>We have to be poor in spirit before we can be filled with the Holy Spirit. Conviction must precede conversion. A real sense of sin must come before there can be a true joy of salvation. That is the essense of the Gospel.</p>\n<p>\"Blessed are they that mourn\".<br /><br />People want joy without the conviction of sin. But that is impossible. It can never be obtained.</p>\n<p>Why is there no record of Jesus ever having laughed?<br />He was a 'man of sorrows, aquainted with grief' - but why?</p>\n<p>As I confront God and His holiness, and contemplate the life that I am meant to live, I see myself, my utter helplessness and hopelessness. I discover my quality of spirit and immediately that makes me mourn.</p>\n<p>Mourning is our reflection upon this wretchedness. Our state of sinfulness. We must ask ourselves 'what is it in me that makes me behave like that. Why am I not able to control myself'. We should hate it.<br /><br />But we should also mourn the sins of others.</p>\n<p>Mourn the state of society and the world. Know that it is all due to sin.<br /><br />THAT is why our Lord Jesus mourned. Why he was a man of sorrows. It is impossible to be merry, to laugh, in the face of knowing ALL THAT SIN, the sin that he took upon himself on the Cross.</p>\n<p>But for our mourning, we are comforted, by Christ's salvation, and the happiness and contentment that that brings. And the hope that lies in the new Kingdom, and Christ's return.</p>\n</div>\n",

It is an emptying. All others are a filling. The beatitudes are in a specific order for a specific reason. Pour out the old wine, before filling with the new.</p>\n<p>There is no more perfect statement of the doctrine of faith alone. It at once condemns every idea of the Sermon on the Mount which thinks in terms of something you and I can do ourselves. <br /><br />It is emphatically NOT 'Blessed in spirit are the poor'.</p>\n<p>It IS 'not possessed by the worldly spirit'. It IS a poverty of spirit. Man's attitude towards himself. Genuinely putting God first, and pride second. <br /><br />This is despised by the world. Self reliance, self confidence and self expression. The hubris of mankind!</p>\n<p>Neither is this Beatitude popular in the Church today. Even in the Church today there is this foolish talk about 'personality'. And personality something purely fleshy and carnal, and a matter of physical appearance. Humility is assumed as lacking in personality!</p>\n<p>But Paul in Corinth went in weakness, fear and trembling. People said he looked weak and his speech, contemptible.<br /><br />But being poor in spirit does not mean retiring, weak or lacking in courage. It does not mean putting on false humility. Our personality must be true</p>\n<p>True humility in the presence of God runs throughout the OT. Having had a vision, Isaiah said 'I am a man of unclean lips'. Paul in the NT was well aware of his own nature, his pride. That is why he uses the word 'boasting' so much.</p>\n<p>That, then is what is meant by being 'poor in spirit'. It means a complete absence of pride, self-assurance and self-reliance. A consciousness that we are NOTHING in the presence of God.<br /><br />The life we have lived or are trying to live, who we are, means nothing.</p>\n</div>\n",
