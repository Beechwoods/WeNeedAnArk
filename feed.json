				"content_text": "<p>On 1 Peter 5:7 After a question asked of @CSLCHSnMore</p>\n<p>The New International Version (NIV) translates 1 Peter 5:7 as 'Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you'.</p>\n<p>J.B Philips' New Testament paraphrase rather beautifully expresses it like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, humble yourselves under God’s strong hand, and in his own good time he will lift you up. You can throw the whole weight of your anxieties upon him, for you are his personal concern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But what does this mean practically?</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"1 Peter 5_7.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/77539/2023/1-peter-5-7.jpg\" alt=\"1 Peter 5 7\" width=\"1996\" height=\"1622\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n<p>I came to Christ in my late forties having spent a lifetime looking for meaning everywhere but in God. Initially my interest in the Bible was one of intellectual curiosity. But as I read that started to change, to a point where things flipped from curiosity to conviction and unequivocal faith.</p>\n<p>It took a while for me to let down my defences and pray properly. But when I did it really felt like throwing myself at Christ’s feet and saying ‘here I am; I believe; you are real and I know you are there for me’.</p>\n<p>To the question asked: when I share my burdens in prayer, or even just get on my knees, address God and mumble jumbled thoughts in my head (which happens when it’s all too much or I’m too tired to think straight) I feel lighter afterwards. Physiologically less stressed. Years ago I was once prescribed diazepam for anxiety and the result is the same (though without the disinhibition associated with medication). When I think about the effect that prayer has on my stress response, given how foreign the concept of prayer was and my initial skepticism about it's power, I still find it remarkable.</p>\n<p>There is a reason why people over the centuries have got on their knees to pray, head bowed, hands clasped. It is a posture of submission. In some respects a posture of defeat; an acknowledgement that my works have failed; that I give myself to you, God. That you have authority and control over me and my circumstances and this world.</p>\n<p>Prayer can be a balm, a salve.</p>\n<p>Throwing your anxieties on God is something very real when you have true belief that He is listening and that in Him you will not be tested beyond your limit. We believers must remember that we have the Holy Spirit within us who strengthens us beyond anything we could have imagined before we were first saved.</p>\n<p>But that is something for another day. You will know it when you see it.</p>\n",

Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.’</p>\n<p>There was purpose and intent to the timing of God’s unveiling for me. Perhaps part of that purpose was that I would write these thoughts down and that they might touch someone. I know that the sadness I have about my lost years pales into nothing compared with the pain Job and Hosea endured in God’s plan.</p>\n<p><strong>Joel 2:25</strong> tells us that God will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, the hopper, the destroyer, and the cutter, my great army, which I sent among you.</p>\n<p>There is life after death. If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; all things are become new. <strong>2 Corinthians 5:17</strong>.</p>\n<p>But still, as a husband and a father, there are things that cannot be changed, the consequence of decisions made by a version of me that was impetuous, immature and thought he had it all figured out.</p>\n<p>When I was a child I remember being taught at school the Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard (<strong>Matthew 20</strong>). The underlying message that God's grace is not earnt but is a gift was not the one I recall being highlighted at the time. It always confused me. Looking back though, there's another element relevant to those of us called Christ late in the day. That we are as valuable to The Lord as those called early.</p>\n<p>If I could go back and do things differently I would. So many things would be easier now if I had realised where the truth lay twenty or thirty years ago. Hindsight is a wonderful thing. But would I have the character I have now, if it weren't for the journey I've been on? When it comes down to it my life is not my own. Christ and the Holy Spirit chose when to bring me to Him. There must have been a reason for that, after all Matthew 7:14 tells us that the gate is narrow <em>and the way is hard</em> that leads to life (<strong>Matthew 7:14</strong>).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lord, remind me how brief my time on earth will be. Remind me that my days are numbered how fleeting my life is. You have made my life no longer than the width of my hand. My entire lifetime is just a moment to you; at best, each of us is but a breath.</p>\n<p><strong>Psalm 39:4-5</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Our life in this world is but a breath. Our inheritance is eternal, pure and undefiled.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is by his great mercy that we have been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead.</p>\n<p>Now we live with great expectation, and we have a priceless inheritance - an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Peter 1:3-4</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n",
